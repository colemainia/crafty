This is my Python 3 chess engine.
I'll be making it on my Macbook Pro.
First, I'll create a game. That is, the program will be able to read in moves, declare invalid ones, and declare a winner. It will essentially know the rules of the game. The last two steps will be to add intelligence and graphics. The order in which that is done will be decided later.
